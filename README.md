# activate-power-mode atom package
This is the version I made based on the original author Joel Besada.
Here is the original work in progress package for Atom to replicate https://github.com/codeinthedark/editor/pull/1 by popular demand.

Activate with `ctrl-alt-o` or through the command panel with `Activate Power Mode: Toggle`. In this
early version it only affects the current tab, to run it in a new tab you need to run `Window: Reload` first.

**NOTE THAT THIS VERSION IS VERY BUGGY RIGHT NOW**
